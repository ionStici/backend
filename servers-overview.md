# Servers

## How servers connect to the Internet

Clients use a URL to connect to a server across the Internet.

URL example: `http://www.example.com`. The URL has four main components:

- `http` _(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)_ is the protocol the browsers and servers use to talk with one another.
- `www` - the _subdomain_
- `example` - the _domain name_
- `com` - the _top-level domain_

In further detail, the following happens:

1. The browser first communicates with the internet service provider (ISP).
2. Then it communicates with the domain name server to the the IP address of the server.
3. The domain name server converts a domain name to an IP address.
4. Using this IP address, the browser connects to the server.
5. Once connected to the web server, our browser sends the request to the server and asks for particular files.
6. When the browser has connected to the server at the correct IP address, the servers send all the requested HTML text for the web page to our browser.

## Types of servers

There are different types of servers based on their uses. Common types of servers:

- A file server is used to store data files for multiple users. They provide users access to stored files and data and can allow faster retrieval and saving of data. These are used on private networks and provide a location for storage of computer files. It provides a central location to store files where multiple users can work with the same documents.

- A database server allows another computer to access the database and retrieve or upload data. This type of server typically has a large storage capacity.

- A web server delivers web pages requested by multiple client web browsers. Mail servers store and deliver email for clients through an email service platform. They are a form of digital ‘post office’ that sorts and stores emails.

- An application server provides a software environment with all the needed requirements. This server allows users to access the application without needing to download additional software.

- The proxy server communicates with the websites you are visiting on your behalf. It links the user with the rest of the internet. The browser connects to the proxy server, and the proxy server sends your request to the website and sends the website’s response back to you.
