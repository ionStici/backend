# Identifying When to Handle Exceptions in NestJS

## Key Areas Needing Exception Handling

### 1. **Database Interactions:**

- **Operations prone to errors:** When you're adding, deleting, querying, or updating data in a database, exceptions can occur. For example, failing to connect to the database or invalid data types can lead to errors.
- **Handling:** Always use exception handling in areas where your service interacts with the database, particularly when working with repositories.

### 2. **Model Constraints:**

- **Unique fields:** Certain fields in your entities, like `email` in a user model, are often set as unique. If you try to insert duplicate values into a unique field without proper checks, the database will throw an error.
- **Handling:** Check for uniqueness and handle exceptions that occur when duplicate entries are detected.

### 3. **External API Interactions:**

- **HTTP Requests:** Whenever your service interacts with external APIs (e.g., fetching user data from Google’s Profile API), you are dealing with potential points of failure.
- **Handling:** Network issues, timeouts, or unexpected responses from the external API can cause exceptions. Ensure you handle these gracefully, especially in parts of your code that depend on these APIs.

### 4. **Middleware:**

- **Custom middleware:** If you're writing middleware for tasks like authentication or logging, exceptions can occur. Although middleware exceptions don't fall under NestJS’s automated exception handling, they should still be handled properly.
- **Handling:** You can throw exceptions in middleware manually and use the same techniques learned for services.

## When to Consider Exception Handling

- **Database Operations:** Always handle exceptions when interacting with databases, especially when writing, deleting, or querying data.
- **Model Constraints:** Look for exceptions related to constraints like unique fields in your models (e.g., duplicate email entries).
- **External APIs:** Handle exceptions when interacting with third-party APIs to account for potential failures or unexpected responses.
- **Middleware:** Exceptions can also occur in middleware, and should be handled there as well, even if it doesn’t fall under the automatic exception boundaries in NestJS.
