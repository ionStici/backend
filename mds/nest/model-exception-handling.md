# Exception Handling Model Constraints

1. **Handling Database Connectivity Issues:**

   - Any interaction with a database (e.g., fetching, creating, updating, deleting) is prone to errors, especially if there are connection issues.
   - In the `catch` block, we throw a `RequestTimeoutException` to handle scenarios where the database is unreachable, signaling to the client that the request could not be processed.

2. **Model Constraint Handling (Unique Email):**

   - Before creating a new user, we check whether a user with the same email already exists. If the email is found, we throw a `BadRequestException` to indicate that the email is not valid because itâ€™s already in use.

3. **Graceful Error Handling:**

   - Exception handling ensures that we provide meaningful, user-friendly error messages. For example, instead of sending a generic `500 Internal Server Error` when a duplicate email is detected, we inform the user with a `400 Bad Request` and a clear message explaining the issue.

4. **Logging Errors (Optional):**

   - In production, you might want to log these errors to a database or file for future debugging. This can be done inside the `catch` block, where you can record detailed error information.

```ts
import { BadRequestException, RequestTimeoutException } from "@nestjs/common";

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  public async createUser(createUserDto: CreateUserDto) {
    let existingUser = undefined;

    try {
      // Check if user exists with the same email
      existingUser = await this.usersRepository.findOne({
        where: { email: createUserDto.email },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle database connectivity issue
      throw new RequestTimeoutException(
        "Unable to process your request at the moment, please try later",
        { description: "Error connecting to the database" }
      );
    }

    // If user already exists, throw a BadRequestException
    if (existingUser) {
      throw new BadRequestException(
        "The user already exists, please check your email."
      );
    }

    // Create a new user
    let newUser = this.usersRepository.create(createUserDto);

    try {
      // Save the new user to the database
      await this.usersRepository.save(newUser);
    } catch (error) {
      // Throw exception if saving the user to database failed
      throw new RequestTimeoutException(
        "Unable to process your request at the moment, please try later",
        { description: "Error connecting to the database" }
      );
    }

    return newUser;
  }
}
```
