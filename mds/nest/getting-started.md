# Getting Started with NestJS

[**NestJS**](https://docs.nestjs.com) is a powerful, progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript by default and provides a structured way to develop applications with built-in support for routing, services, modules, and much more.

```bash
# Install Nest CLI globally
npm install -g @nestjs/cli

# Check if installed
nest --version

# Look for available commands
nest --help

# Create a new Nest app
nest new nest-app

# Start the dev env
npm run start:dev
```
