# Node.js Introduction

[**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s **V8 engine** that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the **server side**.

A **runtime** converts code written in a high-level programming language and compiles it down to code the computer can execute.

## Execute JavaScript Code with Node

- **Node REPL** : Access the Node REPL by typing the command `node` in the terminal. REPL displays the return of each evaluated like. If you'd like to type multiple lines and then have them evaluated at once, type `.editor` to enter editor mode, and then press `control` + `d` for the input to be evaluated.

- **Execute File** : To execute a JavaScript file with node, specify the file name to the `node` command, for example `node index.js`.

### What is REPL

**REPL** (read-eval-print loop) is a program that loops through three different states: a **read** state where the program reads input from the user, the **eval** state where the program evaluates the user's input, and the **print** state where the program prints out its evaluation to the console. Then it **loops** through these states again.
